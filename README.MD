## Docker


By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

### Build Docker Image

```sh
 docker build -f Dockerfile -t book-store .
```

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

### Run Docker image in local system
```sh

docker run -p 8080:8080 -d book-store

```

### Pull Image

I already push image of book-store so you can directly use it for your purpose.

```sh
docker pull sagarandcompany/book-store
```
